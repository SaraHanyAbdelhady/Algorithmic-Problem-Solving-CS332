## 🧩 Tasks Implemented

### 1️⃣ **Tromino Tiling Challenge**  
**Task**: Tile a 2ⁿ × 2ⁿ board with one missing square using L-shaped trominoes in 3 colors  
**Goal**: No two adjacent trominoes share the same color  
**Tech**: ⚔️ Divide & Conquer

---

### 2️⃣ **Knight’s Tour Puzzle**  
**Task**: Can a knight visit every square once and return near the starting point?  
**Variants**: 8×8 and n×n boards  
**Tech**: 🧭 Greedy Algorithm

---

### 3️⃣ **4-Peg Tower of Hanoi**  
**Task**: Move 8 differently sized disks across 4 pegs  
**Challenge**: Solve it in 33 moves  
**Tech**: 🧮 Divide & Conquer + 🧠 Dynamic Programming

---

### 4️⃣ **Knight Swap Game**  
**Task**: Swap black and white knights on a 3×4 board  
**Rules**: No two knights on the same square  
**Tech**: 🔁 Iterative Improvement
